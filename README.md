## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing image preprocessing techniques to help the Segment Anything Model (SAM) identify potential areas of pneumonia in lung X-rays.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Utilize image preprocessing methods to help SAM identify pneumonia through potentially ambiguous lung X-rays.
- **Training SAM:** Feed our preprocessed images through SAM and measure confidence/accuracy.
- **Bounding Boxes Generator:** Generate bounding boxes around SAM-generated masks.
- **Data Evaluation:** Calculate confidence scores and SAM consistency scores.
